              Hello, my name is Claudia Xochitl Perez Ortiz. I am student of Electronics Systems and Robotics in Tecnolico de Monterrey. I am in my second to last semester.

                My field of interest in mainly research. I would like to research and create my entire life. So soon I will start a Mastert Degree in Electronics. My main topic of interest is Electronics and Robotics applied to health purposes. I think these two areas have the capability of making a new revolution in these fields. Right now I am working in a proyect called BCI4ALS. This is a very interesting proyect since it focuses in developing and testing a Brian Computer Interface (BCI) for people with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), processing the signals, and designing applications for the interface.

                On the other hand, I also have hobbies that have nothing to do with my carrer. In my free time I like to practice with makeup and learn new techniques about makeup application and skincare. I also made a football team for women. This is a sport that I love since I think it involes a lot of discipline and excercise. When the season is on, I love watching NFL with my family.
